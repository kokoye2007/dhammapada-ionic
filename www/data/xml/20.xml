	<Title>Five Hundred Monks</Title>
	<Txt>While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verses (273) to (276) of this book, with reference to five hundred monks.
Five hundred monks, after accompanying the Buddha to a village, returned to the Jetavana monastery. In the evening they talked about the trip, especially the nature of the land, whether it was level or hilly, clayey or stony, etc. The Buddha came to them in the midst of their conversation and said to them, "Monks, the path you are talking about is external to you; a monk should only be concerned with the path of the Noble Ones (ariyas) and strive to do what should be done for the attainment of the Ariya Path (Magga) that leads to the realization of the Perfect Peace (Nibbāna)."

	<Title>Thera Tissa the Idle One</Title>
	<Txt>While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (280) of this book, with reference to Tissa, a lazy monk.
Once, five hundred young men were admitted into the Order by the Buddha in Sāvatthī. After receiving a subject of meditation from the Buddha, all the new monks except one went to the forest to practise meditation. They practised zealously and vigilantly so that in due course all of them attained arahatship. When they returned to the monastery to pay homage to him, the Buddha was very pleased and satisfied with their achievement. Monk Tissa who stayed behind did not try hard and therefore achieved nothing.
When Tissa found that the relationship between the Buddha and those monks was very cordial and intimate, he felt rather neglected, and regretted that he had wasted all that time. So he resolved to practise meditation throughout the night. As he was walking in meditation on that night, he slipped and broke a thigh bone. Other monks hearing his cry went to help him. On hearing about the above incident the Buddha said, "Monks, one who does not strive when he should be striving but idle away his time will not attain mental absorption (jhana) and Magga Insight."

	<Title>a Swine-Peta</Title>
	<Txt>While residing at the Veluvana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (281) of this book, with reference to a swine-peta.
Once Thera Maha Moggallana was coming down the Gijjhakuta hill with Thera Lakkhana when he saw a miserable, ever-hungry peta, with the head of a swine and the body of a human being. On seeing the peta, Thera Maha Moggallana smiled but did not say anything. Back at the monastery, Thera Maha Moggallana, in the presence of the Buddha, talked about the swine-peta with its mouth swarming with maggots. The Buddha also said that he himself had seen that very peta soon after his attainment of Buddhahood, but that he did not say anything about it because people might not believe him and thus they would be doing wrong to him. Then the Buddha proceeded to relate the story about the swine-peta.
During the time of Kassapa Buddha, this particular peta was a monk who often expounded the Dhamma. On one occasion, he came to a monastery where two monks were staying together. After staying with those two for some time, he found that he was doing quite well because people liked his expositions. Then it occurred to him that it would be even better if he could make the other two monks leave the place and have the monastery all to himself. Thus, he tried to set one against the other. The two monks quarrelled and left the monastery in different directions. On account of this evil deed, that monk was reborn in Avici Niraya and he was serving out the remaining part of his term of suffering as a swine-peta with its mouth swarming with maggots. Then the Buddha exhorted, "A monk should be calm and well-restrained in thought, word and deed."

	<Title>Thera Potthila</Title>
	<Txt>While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (282) of this book, with reference to Thera Potthila.
Potthila was a senior monk who knew the Pitaka well and was actually teaching the Dhamma to five hundred monks. Because he knew the Pitaka, he was also very conceited. The Buddha knew his weakness and wanted him to mend his ways and put him on the right path. So, whenever Potthila came to pay obeisance, the Buddha would address him as 'Useless Potthila'. When Potthila heard these remarks, he pondered over those words of the Buddha and came to realize that the Buddha had made those unkind remarks because he, Potthila, had not made any serious effort to practise meditation and had not achieved any of the Maggas or even any level of mental absorption (jhana).
Thus, without telling anyone Thera Potthila left for a monastery at a place twenty yojanas away from the Jetavana monastery. At that monastery there were thirty monks. First, he went to the most senior monk and humbly requested him to be his mentor; but the thera, wishing to humble him, asked him to go to the next senior monk, who in his turn sent him on to the next. In this way, he was sent from one to the other until he came to a seven year old arahat samanera. The young samanera accepted him as a pupil only after ascertaining that Potthila would obediently follow his instructions. As instructed by the samanera, Thera Potthila kept his mind firmly fixed on the true nature of the body; he was very ardent and vigilant in his meditation.
The Buddha saw Potthila in his vision and through supernormal power made Potthila feel his presence and encouraged him to be steadfast and ardent.

	<Title>Five Old Monks</Title>
	<Txt>While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verses (283) and (284) of this book, with reference to five old monks.
Once, in Sāvatthī, there were five friends who became monks only in their old age. These five monks were in the habit of going together to their old homes for alms-food. Of the former wives of those five, one lady in particular, by the name of Madhurapacika was a good cook and she looked after them very well. Thus, the five monks went mostly to her house. But one day, Madhurapacika fell ill and died suddenly. The old monks felt their loss very deeply and together they cried praising her virtues and lamenting their loss.
The Buddha called those monks to him and said, "Monks! You all are feeling pain and sorrow because you are not free from greed, hatred, and ignorance (raga, dosa, moha), which are like a forest. Cut down this forest and you will be freed from greed, hatred and ignorance."

	<Title>a Thera who had been a Goldsmith</Title>
	<Txt>While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (285) of this book, with reference to a monk, a pupil of Thera Sariputta.
Once, a young, handsome son of a goldsmith was admitted into the Order by Thera Sariputta. The young monk was given loathsomeness of the dead body as the subject of meditation by Thera Sariputta. After taking the subject of meditation he left for the forest and practised meditation there; but he made very little progress. So he returned twice to Thera Sariputta for further instructions. Still, he made no progress. So Thera Sariputta took the young monk to the Buddha, and related everything about the young monk.
The Buddha knew that the young monk was the son of a goldsmith, and also that he had been born in the family of goldsmiths during his past five hundred existences. Therefore the Buddha changed the subject of meditation for the young monk; instead of loathsomeness, he was instructed to meditate on pleasantness. With his supernormal power, the Buddha created a beautiful lotus flower as big as a cart-wheel and told the young monk to stick it on the mound of sand just outside the monastery. The young monk, concentrating on the big, beautiful, fragrant lotus flower, was able to get rid of the hindrances. He was filled with delightful satisfaction (piti), and step by step he progressed until he reached as far as the fourth level of mental absorption (jhana).
The Buddha saw him from his perfumed chamber and with his supernormal power made the flower wither instantly. Seeing the flower wither and change its colour, the monk perceived the impermanent nature of the flower and of all other things and beings. That led to the realization of the impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and the insubstantiality of all conditioned things. At that instant, the Buddha sent forth his radiance and appeared as if in person to the young monk and instructed him to get rid of craving (tanha).

	<Title>Mahadhana, a Merchant</Title>
	<Txt>While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (286) of this book, with reference to Mahadhana, a merchant from Baranasi.
Once, a merchant from Baranasi came to a festival in Sāvatthī with five hundred carts fully loaded with textiles and other merchandise. When he reached a river bank near Sāvatthī the river was in spate; so he could not cross the river. He was held up for seven days as it was raining hard and the water did not subside. By that time, he was already late for the festival, and there was no need for him to cross the river.
Since he had come from a long distance he did not want to return home with his full load of merchandise. So he decided to spend the rainy season, the cold season and the hot season in that place and said so to his assistants. The Buddha while going on an alms-round knew the decision of the merchant and he smiled. Ananda asked the Buddha why he smiled and the Buddha replied,"Ananda, do you see that merchant? He is thinking that he would stay here and sell his goods the whole year. He is not aware that he would die here in seven days' time. What should be done should be done today. Who would know that one would die tomorrow? We have no date fixed with the King of Death. For one who is mindful by day or by night, who is not disturbed by moral defilements and is energetic, to live for just one night is a well-spent life."
Then the Buddha sent Ananda to Mahadhana, the merchant. Ananda explained to Mahadhana that time was running out for him, and that he should practise mindfulness instead of being negligent. On learning about his impending death, Mahadhana was alarmed and frightened. So, for seven days, he invited the Buddha and other monks for alms-food. On the seventh day, the Buddha expounded a discourse in appreciation (anumodana).

As Patacara had lost her husband and her two sons, as well as her parents and three brothers almost at the same time, she was driven to near insanity. When she approached the Buddha, he said to her, "Patacara, sons and daughters cannot look after you; so even if they are alive they do not exist for you. The wise man observes morality (sila) and clears (the obstacles to) the Path leading to Nibbāna."
