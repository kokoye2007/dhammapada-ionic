He was known as Ekudana, because he knew only one stanza of exultation (Udana) by heart. But the thera fully understood the meaning of the Dhamma as conveyed by the stanza. On each sabbath day, he would exhort others to listen to the Dhamma, and he himself would recite the one stanza he knew. Every time he had finished his recitation, the guardian spirits (devas) of the forests praised him and applauded him resoundingly. On one sabbath day, two learned theras, who were well-versed in the Tipitaka, accompanied by five hundred monks came to his place. Ekudana asked the two theras to preach the Dhamma. They enquired if there were many who wished to listen to the Dhamma in this out of the way place. Ekudana answered in the affirmative and also told them that even the guardian spirits of the forests usually came, and that they usually praised and applauded at the end of discourses.\nSo, the two learned theras took turns to preach the Dhamma, but when their discourses ended, there was no applause from the guardian spirits of the forests. The two learned theras were puzzled; they even doubted the words of Ekudana. But Ekudana insisted that the guardian spirits used to come and always applauded at the end of each discourse. The two theras then pressed Ekudana to do the preaching himself. Ekudana held the fan in front of him and recited the usual stanza. At the end of the recitation, the guardian spirits applauded as usual. The monks who had accompanied the two learned theras complained that the devas inhabiting the forests were very partial.\nThey reported the matter to the Buddha on arrival at the Jetavana monastery. To them the Buddha said. \"Monks! I do not say that a monk who has learnt much and talks much of the Dhamma is one who is versed in the Dhamma, (Dhammadhara).\" One who has learnt very little and knows only one stanza of the Dhamma, but fully comprehends the Four Noble Truths, and is ever mindful is the one who is truly versed in the Dhamma.\""

Since the followers of the Buddha were silent when ascetics of other doctrines were saying things which were pleasing to their disciples, people began to compare the two groups.\nWhen the Buddha heard about this, he permitted the monks to say words of blessing to their disciples after receiving offerings. As a result of that, more and more people invited the followers of the Buddha for alms. Then, the ascetics of other doctrines remarked with disdain: \"We adhere to the practice of the muni and keep silent, whereas the followers of Samana Gotama go about talking exuberantly in the eating places.\" On hearing those disparaging remarks, the Buddha said, \"Monks!

                        "Txt": "While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verses (271) and (272) of this book, with reference to some monks.\nOnce, there were some monks who were endowed with virtue; some of them had strictly observed the austere practices (dhutanga), some had wide knowledge of' the Dhamma, some had achieved mental absorption (jhana), some had achieved Anagami Phala, etc. All of them thought that since they had achieved that much, it would be quite easy for them to attain Arahatta Phala. With this thought they went to the Buddha.\nThe Buddha asked them, \"Monks, have you attained Arahatta Phala?\" Then they replied that they were in such a condition that it would not be difficult for them to attain Arahatta Phala at any time. To them the Buddha said, \"Monks! Just because you are endowed with morality (sila), just because you have attained Anagami Phala, you should not be complacent and think that there is just a little more to be done; unless you have eradicated all moral intoxicants (asavas), you must not think that you have realized perfect bliss of Arahatta Fruition.\""
