They were so attached to one another that they rarely stayed apart.

Other monks reported their behaviour to the Buddha and he called them to his presence, and said to them, \"Once you have joined the Order, you should no longer stay together like a family. Not seeing those who are dear, and seeing those who are not dear to one, are both painful; so you should not hold any being or anything dear to you\"."
